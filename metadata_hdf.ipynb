        "\t\t\t<abstract>The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is an advanced multispectral imager that was launched on board NASA's Terra spacecraft in December, 1999.  The ASTER Level-1T (L1T) data incorporate radiometric and geometric corrections while employing ASTER 30-meter Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for topographic accuracy. All of these data are stored together with metadata in one HDF file. The L1T image is projected onto a rotated map (rotated to path oriented coordinate) at full instrument resolutions. The Level-1T data generation also includes registration of the SWIR and TIR data to the VNIR data. And in addition, for SWIR in particular, the parallax errors due to the spatial locations of all of its bands are corrected.  The Level-1T data set provide scaled or calibrated radiance values.  Scenes with sufficient elevation and ground control data for terrain correction are processed to Level 1T.</abstract>\n",
        "\t\t\t<purpose>ASTER Level 1T data are used by investigators of every discipline to support their research.  The high spatial resolution of the ASTER Level 1T data will complement lower resolution data acquired more frequently by other EOS instruments.</purpose>\n",
